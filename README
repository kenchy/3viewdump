v0.1 24/01/2011

This program results from a search for a method to download programs from my 3view Freeview HD recorder.
The recorder exposes all of the recordings using UPNP.
People were coming up with mechanisms using windows media player, and chunks of HTML.

I don't really use windows, and I don't want to use a browser to do this.

I cam across the Net::UPNP perl class which includes an example called dms2vodcast,
which I have adapted to my purposes. Thanks to the original author.

Usage:

install Net::UPNP and Date::Manip 

./3viewdump.pl -s "Case Sensitive Search String" -a <Date of recording YYYYMMDD> name_of_rss_file

example:

./3viewdump.pl -s Peppa -a 20101220 test.rss
will download all of the Peppas from the 20th December 2010, (there are a lot of them)

DONE:
Can query 3view server on local LAN, not sure if this will currently work with other UPNP servers
Will download all hits

ISSUES:
Command requires an RSS file to output to. This will be removed. As the code is there, will
make an option so you can generate a page of links to content on the 3view.
Lots of cruft.
SD Files need to be run through ffmpeg to make them easily playable.
Same issue with HD files but ffmpeg doesn't fix them.
Downloads files twice, possibly hitting them from the 'order by title'and 'order by date'
