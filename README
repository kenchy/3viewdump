v0.1 24/01/2011

This program results from a search for a method to download programs from my 3view Freeview HD recorder.
The recorder exposes all of the recordings using UPNP.
People were coming up with mechanisms using windows media player, and chunks of HTML.

I don't really use windows, and I don't want to use a browser to do this.

I cam across the Net::UPNP perl class which includes an example called dms2vodcast,
which I have adapted to my purposes. Thanks to the original author.

Usage:

install Net::UPNP, curl and ffmpeg

./3viewdump.pl -s "Case Sensitive Search String" -a <Date of recording YYYYMMDD>

example:

./3viewdump.pl -s Peppa -a 20101220
will download all of the Peppas from the 20th December 2010, (there are a lot of them)

DONE:
Can query 3view server on local LAN, not sure if this will currently work with other UPNP servers
Will download all hits

ISSUES:
Lots of cruft.
SD Files need to be run through ffmpeg to make them easily playable.
Same issue with HD files but ffmpeg doesn't fix them.
Downloads files twice, hitting them from the 'order by title'and 'order by date'

TODO:
Don't download files generate an RSS feed with links to the server.
